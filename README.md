# go-htmx-expense-tracker (greed)

Great exercise on Go + HTMX (with Hyperscript) + Turso

On pause (although core functionality is all done more or less), since I want to build something for myself only and I don't want to implement the stupid auth system (even predefined token-based) + cookies shit (sessions so that I don't need to re-login every time) just so that I am the only person in the world who can access this thing from the internet

So I am going with mobile app route, and if that won't work, I'll try to finish this
