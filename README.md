# go-htmx-expense-tracker (greed)

Great exercise on Go + HTMX (with Hyperscript) + Turso

The idea of web app is on pause (although core functionality + simple UI is all done more or less), since I want to build something for myself only and I don't want to implement the stupid auth system (even predefined token-based) + cookies (sessions so that I don't need to re-login every time) just so that I am the only person in the world who can access this thing from the internet

On track to repurpose the logic into JSON API for the mobile app
